# python-pyramid-patterns
Easy to understand python codes to print certain patterns("pyramids") for 12th grade CS/IP and 1st year engineering classes. These types of patterns are commonly used in various basic programming exercises and can be a good exercise to practice loops and pattern printing.
Here's what some of these patterns look like:

1. Lower Triangle Pattern aka "Simple pyramid pattern":
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```
2. Upper Triangle Pattern aka "Right Aligned/Right justified pyramid":
```
* * * * * 
  * * * * 
    * * * 
      * * 
        * 
```
3. Lower Triangle Pattern flipped 180 degrees aka "Mirrored simple pyramid or Mirrored Lower Triangle":
```
        * 
      * * 
    * * * 
  * * * * 
* * * * * 
```
4. Left Justified Upper Triangle Pattern:
```
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```
5. Simple pyramid pattern aka "Triangular pyramid or Triangular prism":
```
    * 
   * * 
  * * * 
 * * * * 
* * * * * 
```
